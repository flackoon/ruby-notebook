# Designing your library

## The simplest possible interface

The best way to make sure the users like what they see is to make your library as simple as possible to use. *How do you
make your library simple to use?* Think of what the library should do, and then what the simplest interface for it would
be.

If you don't have an idea how to implement the interface for the library at this point â€“ it's perfectly ok. When
designing an interface for a library, you don't need know how to implement it. It might even be better if you don't
have a clear idea of how to implement the interface, because it could discourage you from writing a better interface
that would be more work to implement, and instead choose a worse interface that is easier to implement initially.

While it isn't necessary to know upfront how to implement a given interface, it's useful to have a basic idea of whether
it is possible to implement the interface you want.
